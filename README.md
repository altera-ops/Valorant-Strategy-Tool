[![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/altera-project/Valorant-Strategy-Tool.svg?branch=master)](http://inch-ci.org/github/altera-project/Valorant-Strategy-Tool)

## Concept
We want to develop a tool with the VALORANT community to help players create strategies on the fly, together, and in real-time. We're making it possible with GitHub. See our original post about this project on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/comments/gg58r2/valorant_strategy_tool/Reddit).
